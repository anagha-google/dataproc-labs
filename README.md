# Open Data Analytics Labs on GCP

This repo hosts minimum viable self-contained, end-to-end solutions that showcase Spark on GCP and its integration with other GCP services. They are intended to demystify our products and their integration.

## Scalable Infrastructure for Regulated Organizations

Google Cloudâ€™s [Assured Workloads](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/assured-workloads?e=48754805&hl=en) helps ensure that regulated organizations across the public and private sector can accelerate AI innovation while meeting their compliance and security requirements. Assured Workloads provides control packages to support the creation of compliant boundaries in Google Cloud. A control package is a set of controls that, when combined together, supports the regulatory baseline for a compliance statute or regulation. These controls include mechanisms to enforce data residency, data sovereignty, personnel access, and more.

We encourage you to evaluate Assured Workloads' [control packages](https://cloud.google.com/assured-workloads/docs/control-packages) and decide whether a control package is required for your organization to meet their regulatory and compliance requirements. If so, we recommend you first deploy Assured Workloads using [this repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/assured-workloads-terraform), allowing you to maintain your regulatory and compliance requirements, before running these labs.

Note that unsupported products are not recommended for use by Assured Workloads customers without due diligence and waivers from your regulatory agencies or divisions.
